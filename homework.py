#If there are 10 million fruits in the list and the user is wants to know if 'apple' is in the first, 
# fortunately, apple happens to be the first fruit in the list. Now ask yourself, after the code finds 
# apple early on in the list, will it continue to search through the remain items in the list or it 
# will pause there. Think about it, find out what your code does and let me know.
